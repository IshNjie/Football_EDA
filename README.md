# EDA Football Standings

The idea of this project was to learn how to build an interactive web-app in Python using Streamlit - find the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/ishnjie/football_eda/Football-standings-app.py). Please note: access the app on Chrome, does not seem to work on Safari

The data source for this data-driven project can be found [here](https://github.com/azharimm/football-standings-api)
